My family adopted her in 2013 from WagTime in downtown DC. Something interesting is that my birthday, my sister's birthday, and Freckles birthday are April 9th, 10th, and 11th, respectively. We were born on different years though.</p>

            <p id="about-text" class="page-text">If I had more content, there would be a seperate page for some information about this website and myself. The author of this website is me, Kyle Clemente. This website was made for Professor Dietz's class. I have lived in Washington DC my whole life. I am a first-year student at American University. My current major is computer science. I enjoy computer science a lot - creating websites, coding, solving problems - but I might switch my major to biology. Also, I have a job at a company designing and managing websites.</p>
